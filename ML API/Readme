# Deploying a Machine Learning Model as an API


Aim:
To suggest a price to a customer adding a new listing (e.g. apartment for sale) based on the details of the property.

Functions:
1. Training a model predicting the price based on an existing dataset.
2. Creating a REST API that will make predictions using that model, returning suggested price based on the provided characteristics of a given property.


For example, 
Using the Boston housing dataset and I created a JSON API.
A REST query to the service with parameters is shown below.


POST score:

{
“CRIM”: 0.00632,
“age”: 65.2
}


will return the predicted price as below:

{
“price”: 145000
}
