# Demo of CARET (Classification And Regression Training) package for any supervised machine learning problem:

## It provides a uniform interface to several machine learning algorithms and standardizes various other tasks such as Data splitting, Pre-processing, Feature selection, Variable importance estimation etc 

This project showcases implementation of various stages using the package,
* Pre-processing using Caret
* Splitting the data using Caret
* Feature selection using Caret
* Training models using Caret
* Parameter tuning using Caret
* Variable importance estimation using Caret
* Making predictions using Caret
