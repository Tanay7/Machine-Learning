# Sentiment_analysis-using-Textblob

## Sentiment analysis: 
Understanding and extracting feelings from data. I am using the tweepy library to access the Twitter API and the TextBlob library to perform Sentiment Analysis on each Tweet. Textblob-->Library of Python to perform sentiment analysis (good for NLP tasks)

# Dependencies:
pip install tweepy 

pip install textblob

I am also printing out each tweet and saving each Tweet to a CSV file with an associated label. The label is either 'Positive' or 'Negative'.

I have also defined the sentiment polarity threshold.
