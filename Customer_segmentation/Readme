## Description

- Customer segmentation 


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
## Key findings : 

1. Loyalty (refer Loyalty graphs.pdf) (The pdfs need to be downloaded to be magnified)

  As you can see from the pdf, the users with no activity on the site increase from 26% to 98% in the next month (April).
Concurrently, the medium-low value users also tend to decrease from 60% to 5% 

2. Engagement (refer Engagement graphs.pdf)

  As you can see from the pdf, the users with no engagement on the site increase from 27% to 95% in the next month (April) due to email marketing efforts by the team.
  However, the completion rate seems to be falling drastically no matter what.
  
3. Interest (refer Interest graphs.pdf)

  As you can see from the pdf, the users with no Interest (in various courses) on the site increase from 5% to 95% in the next month (April).
  The users with Narrow focus (No. of different courses enrolled) decreases from 55% to 5%

4. Value (refer Value graphs.pdf)

  As you can see from the pdf, the users with no Value (no propensity to spend) on the site remains the same which is justifiable as Capernaum is dedicated to providing free education
  and hence targets the users with negligible tendency to spend/purchase.
  However, you can see that due to the inclusion of new courses and the arduous efforts by our Marketing team the percentage of High purchasers do spikes up.
  
Overall, I was responsible for creating different personas via dendrograms for effective email marketing/push notifications at Capernaum.
